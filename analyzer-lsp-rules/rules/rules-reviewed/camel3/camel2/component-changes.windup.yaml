  - message: The `org.apache.camel:camel-kafka` component has removed the options
      `bridgeEndpoint` and `circularEndpointDetection` as they are no longer needed
      because the component is acting as bridging would work on Camel 2.x. In other
      words camel-kafka will send messages to the topic from the endpoint uri. To
      override this use the KafkaConstants.OVERRIDE_TOPIC header with the new topic.
      See more details in the camel-kafka component documentation.
