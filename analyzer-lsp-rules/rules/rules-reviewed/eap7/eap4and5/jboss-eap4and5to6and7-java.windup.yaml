      specific.. In JBoss EAP 6+ these mbean-related components (i.e., `org.jboss.mx.*`)
      have been removed in an effort to make the container more Java EE 6 specification
      compliant.. One will need to find an equivalent replacement: for class `MBeanProxyExt.create()`
      one can use `JMX.newMBeanProxy()`.'

  - message: JMX / MBeans is still fully supported as it is in the JDK specification..
      If your MBeans were extending the old JBoss EAP MBean support classes such as
      `org.jboss.system.ServiceMBean` and `org.jboss.system.ServiceMBeanSupport`,
      these do not exist in JBoss EAP 6+.. These classes were hooked into the kernel
      in previous versions of JBoss EAP where everything was basically turned into
      an MBean.
