      Beans.  \n                        The internal architecture has changed in JBoss
      EAP 6+ and is no longer based on an MBean JMX architecture.\n                        \n

      JBoss EAP 4.x the JBoss 'kernel' layer was an extension of JMX which is why
      everything was an MBean, though most of the MBean functionality still worked
      in JBoss EAP 5.  \n                         JBoss EAP 6 is no longer based on
      Mbeans, and the Mbeans which are seen in jconsole are actually just facades
      over the JBoss management API, so declaring Mbean dependencies on any other
      Mbeans that appear to be JBoss Mbeans does not work since they are not real
      Mbeans.  \n                        \n                    "
