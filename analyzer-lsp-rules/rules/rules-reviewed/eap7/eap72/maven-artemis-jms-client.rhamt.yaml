  - message: If you migrate your application to JBoss EAP 7.3 (or later), and want
      to ensure its Maven building, running or testing works as expected, if the application
      depends on Artemis JMS Client artifact then it should also depend on artifact
      with groupId `org.jboss.eap`, and artifactId `wildfly-client-properties`.
