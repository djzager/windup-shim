  - message: "\n                        The modules required by JOTM's JTA implementation
      are not loaded by default on EAP6+.\n                        This likely results
      in a \"java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: sun/rmi/server/UnicastServerRef\" exception
      when it is deployed.\n\n                        To solve this issue it is highly
      recommended to use JTA provided by JBoss EAP since JOTM is not maintained anymore.
      \ \n                        \n                        If you want to stick with
      JOTM, you can add \"sun/rmi/server\" as system export in your applications deployment-structure.xml
      as described in [this knowledge base article](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1217863).\n
