      was found in a configuration file.\n\n                        There are three
      core steps when registering a data source with JBoss EAP in Azure App Service:
      uploading the JDBC driver, adding the JDBC driver as a module, and registering
      the module.\n\n                        App Service is a stateless hosting service,
      so the configuration commands for adding and registering the data source module
      must be scripted and applied as the container starts.\n                        \n
      \                       For more information, see Datasource Management in the
      JBoss EAP documentation.                        \n                        \n
