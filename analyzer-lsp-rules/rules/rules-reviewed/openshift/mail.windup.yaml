- - message: The configuration parameters of SMTP services for outbound mail may contain
      environment-specific values such as static IP addresses, host names, properties,
      credentials, or certificates.. Recommendations. * In a cloud environment, mail
      systems should be considered backing services and treated like attached resources..
      * Ensure that the configuration of the underlying outbound mail connection is
      not environment-specific.. * In OpenShift Container Platform, store configuration
      parameters as environment variables or in a ConfigMap.
