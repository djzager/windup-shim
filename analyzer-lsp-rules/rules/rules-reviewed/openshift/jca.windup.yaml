- - message: 'The application contains an embedded resource adapter descriptor (''ra.xml''),
      which implements the Java Connector Architecture (JCA) for certain Enterprise
      Information Systems (EIS).. JCA often uses tightly coupled interactions between
      the connector and the application. Tight coupling is not suitable in a cloud
      environment because of scalability problems.. Recommendation: Review the purpose
      of the resource adapter to determine whether it is required in a cloud environment.'
