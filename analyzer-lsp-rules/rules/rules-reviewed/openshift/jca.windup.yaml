  - message: "\n                The application contains an embedded resource adapter
      descriptor ('ra.xml'), which implements the Java Connector Architecture (JCA)
      for certain Enterprise Information Systems (EIS).\n\n                JCA often
      uses tightly coupled interactions between the connector and the application.
      Tight coupling is not suitable in a cloud environment because of scalability
      problems.\n\n                Recommendation: Review the purpose of the resource
      adapter to determine whether it is required in a cloud environment.\n                "
