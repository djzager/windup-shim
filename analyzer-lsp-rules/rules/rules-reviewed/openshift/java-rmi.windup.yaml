- - message: Java RMI is a tightly coupled service. Tight coupling is not suitable
      in a cloud environment because of scalability problems.. Recommendations. Use
      Java EE standard or loosely coupled protocols for backing service interactions:.
      ** Message-based communication (JMS) for asynchronous use cases. ** HTTP-based
      protocol or API (JAX-RS and JAX-WS) for synchronous use cases. When used with
      load-balancing, both options ensure scalability and high availability.
