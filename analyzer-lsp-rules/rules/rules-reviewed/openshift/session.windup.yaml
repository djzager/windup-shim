- - message: Session replication ensures that client sessions are not disrupted by
      node failure. Each node in the cluster shares information about ongoing sessions
      and can take over sessions if another node disappears. In a cloud environment,
      however, data in the memory of a running container can be wiped out by a restart..
      Recommendations. * Review the session replication usage and ensure that it is
      configured properly.. * Disable HTTP session clustering and accept its implications..
      * Re-architect the application so that sessions are stored in a cache backing
      service or a remote data grid.. A remote data grid has the following benefits:.
      * The application is more scaleable and elastic.. * The application can survive
      EAP node failures because a JVM failure does not cause session data loss.. *
      Session data can be shared by multiple applications.
