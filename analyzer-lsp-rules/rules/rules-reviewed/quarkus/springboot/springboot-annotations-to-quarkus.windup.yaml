      annotation.\n\n                        A Spring Boot application contains a
      \"main\" class with the @SpringBootApplication annotation. A Quarkus application
      does not have such a class. Two different alternatives can be followed - either\n
      \                       to remove the \"main\" class associated with the annotation,
      or add the `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-autoconfigure` dependency as
      an `optional` Maven dependency. An optional dependency \n                        is
      available when an application compiles but is not packaged with the application
      at runtime. Doing this would allow the application to compile without modification,
      but you\n                        would also need to maintain a Spring version
      along with the Quarkus application.\n                    "
