- - message: Remove the SpringBoot @SpringBootApplication annotation.. A Spring Boot
      application contains a "main" class with the @SpringBootApplication annotation.
      A Quarkus application does not have such a class. Two different alternatives
      can be followed - either. to remove the "main" class associated with the annotation,
      or add the `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-autoconfigure` dependency as
      an `optional` Maven dependency. An optional dependency. is available when an
      application compiles but is not packaged with the application at runtime. Doing
      this would allow the application to compile without modification, but you. would
      also need to maintain a Spring version along with the Quarkus application.
