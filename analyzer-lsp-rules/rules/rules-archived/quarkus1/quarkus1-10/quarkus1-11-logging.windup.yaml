- - message: If you are using `DEBUG` or `TRACE` log levels, we made an important
      change in our logging layer:. a new build-time `min-level` configuration property
      was introduced that sets the minimum log level you will be able to use at runtime..
      So if you are logging at `DEBUG` level for some loggers, setting `min-level`
      to `DEBUG` (or `TRACE`) is required.
