  - message: A recent change was made to MongoDB panache to bring it in to conformity
      with the Hibernate Panache behavior.. Public field accesses on `MongoEntity`
      and `ReactiveMongoEntity` types are now wrapped with the appropriate `get` or
      `set` methods.. In general, you will like not see any difference in your application..
      However, if you have written a custom `get` or `set` method you may notice a
      change in behavior if those custom methods deviate from the standard `get`/`set`
      paradigm.
