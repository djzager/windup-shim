- - message: The biggest change here is that to start your Quarkus application, you
      should now use:. `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar` (instead of
      using the versioned `-runner` jar).. This change will concern all your applications
      as soon as you have upgraded them to 1.12.. For those who want to stick to the
      legacy jar packaging, they can go back to the previous behavior by adding the
      following property to the `application.properties`:. `quarkus.package.type=legacy-jar`
