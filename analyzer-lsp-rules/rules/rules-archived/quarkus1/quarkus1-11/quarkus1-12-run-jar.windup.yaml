      change here is that to start your Quarkus application, you should now use:\n
      \                           `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar` (instead
      of using the versioned `-runner` jar).\n\n                            This change
      will concern all your applications as soon as you have upgraded them to 1.12.\n
      \                           \n                            For those who want
      to stick to the legacy jar packaging, they can go back to the previous behavior
      by adding the following property to the `application.properties`:\n                            `quarkus.package.type=legacy-jar`\n
      \                                                   \n                        "
