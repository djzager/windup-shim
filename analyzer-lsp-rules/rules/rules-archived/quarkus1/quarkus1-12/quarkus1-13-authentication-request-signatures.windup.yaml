- - message: New methods signatures have been added to the `AuthenticationRequest`
      interface to allow transportation. of additional context information with the
      request such as context path, HTTP header or query parameter values.. If you
      were implementing this interface before, you can now extend `BaseAuthenticationRequest`
      in 1.13 without having to implement the new methods.
