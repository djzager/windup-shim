  - message: The goal `native-image` of `quarkus-maven-plugin` had long been deprecated
      and the plugin had been logging a warning since 1.11.1.Final.. It has now finally
      been removed in 1.13. Please remove the plugin execution from your `pom.xml`
      and simply add the following property to your native profile:. ```Xml. <properties>.
      <quarkus.package.type>native</quarkus.package.type>. </properties>. ```. In
      case you have been setting non-default configuration parameters like. ```. <enableHttpsUrlHandler>true</enableHttpsUrlHandler>.
      ```. ,replace those with the respective documented properties, e.g.. ```. <quarkus.native.enable-https-url-handler>true</quarkus.native.enable-https-url-handler>.
      ```
