      of `quarkus-maven-plugin` had long been deprecated and the plugin had been logging
      a warning since 1.11.1.Final.\n\n                        It has now finally
      been removed in 1.13. Please remove the plugin execution from your `pom.xml`
      and simply add the following property to your native profile:\n                        \n
      \                       ```Xml\n                        <properties>\n                            <quarkus.package.type>native</quarkus.package.type>\n
      \                       </properties>\n                        ```\n                        In
      case you have been setting non-default configuration parameters like\n                        ```\n
      \                       <enableHttpsUrlHandler>true</enableHttpsUrlHandler>\n
      \                       ```\n                         ,replace those with the
      respective documented properties, e.g. \n                        ```\n                        <quarkus.native.enable-https-url-handler>true</quarkus.native.enable-https-url-handler>\n
      \                       ```\n                        \n                    "
